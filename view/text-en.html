<p>Latest versions of WordPress aren't loading jQuery in front-end by default, so recently when I was developing a custom plugin that required to use jQuery only to make some Ajax calls I decided to write this code instead of load the entire jQuery library. Although it was made for WordPress it also could be used in other projects where/when you need posting form-encoded data (SPA or SSR apps like this one).</p>
<p>Since a while, I'm using JavaScript fetch() interface to make ajax calls in all my projects, it's agnostic, it's modern, it's cool.</p>
<p>But the "problem" with WordPress was serialize form data in the right way, specially nested data. I'd already decided to write my own solution to properly serialize form data when I found this code (after all who needs to reinventing the wheel?): <a href="https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/javascript+url+encode+object+recursive" target="_blank">https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/javascript+url+encode+object+recursive</a>. </p>
<p>I wrapped my code as a JS class, the URL of the web service is set on instantiation time. Well, say no more; check the samples and let's play (don't forget enable your browser Inspector to trace the Ajax interaction):</p>
